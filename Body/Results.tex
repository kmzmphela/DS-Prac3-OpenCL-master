\section{Results}
The results section is for presenting and discussing your findings.  You can split it into subsections if the experiment has multiple sections or stages.

\subsection{Figures}
Include good quality graphs (see Fig.~\ref{fig:r_vs_N;_f=0_0005;_P=90}).  These were produced by the Octave code presented in listings~\ref{lst:FormatFig} and~\ref{lst:PlotExample}.  You can play around with the \texttt{PaperSize} and \texttt{PaperPosition} variables to change the aspect ratio.  An easy way to obtain more space on a paper is to use wide, flat figures, such as Fig.~\ref{fig:Line_Signals}.
